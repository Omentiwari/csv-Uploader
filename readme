CSV Upload File Backend
This project is a CSV file upload system built using Node.js, EJS, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to be responsive across all devices.

## Features
File Upload: Users can upload CSV files into the system using Multer JS. File Management: Displays a list of all uploaded CSV files. Each file is parsed, converted into JSON, and stored in a Mongo Database. Data Display: Upon selecting a file, it displays all the data (with column headers) in a table on the frontend. Search Functionality: Includes a search box that filters and displays matching rows in the table based on user input. An empty search box displays all the data. Sorting: Enables sorting functionality (ascending and descending) for each column in the table. File Type Validation: Provides validation both on the frontend and server-side, allowing only CSV file uploads. Pagination: Implements pagination for the displayed table data, limiting it to a maximum of 100 records per page.
